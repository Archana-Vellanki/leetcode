# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
# Medium

# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.

# Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

# Your solution must use only constant extra space.


# Example 1:

# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
# Example 2:

# Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
# Example 3:

# Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].


# Constraints:

# 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
# -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
# numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# -1000 <= target <= 1000
# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.


# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
# Approach: Two pointers technique; Iterate through the array starting with left pointer at the beginning and right pointer at the end.
# Calculate the sum of the elements at left and right indices.
# if the sum > target it means we should reduce the sum, hence reduce the right pointer by 1
# if the sum < target it means we should increase the sum, hence increase the left pointer by 1
# if it is equal return the indices increased by 1 since it is 1-indexed
