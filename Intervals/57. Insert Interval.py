# 57. Insert Interval

# Hint
# You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

# Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

# Return intervals after the insertion.

# Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
# Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
# Example 2:

# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
# Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
# Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= intervals.length <= 104
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
# intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
# newInterval.length == 2
# 0 <= start <= end <= 105

# Intuition: Segregate intervals into three groups: those completely before the new interval, those overlapping with it, and those completely after it. Merge the overlapping intervals into one.

# Implementation:
# Append non-overlapping intervals before the new interval.
# Update the new intervalâ€™s boundaries while merging with any overlapping intervals.
# Append the merged interval and any remaining intervals after it.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n) (if we count the output)
