# 876. Middle of the Linked List

# Topics

# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [4,5,6]
# Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# Approach: Fast and slow pointers. Fast pointer will proceed two nodes in each step and slow pointer proceeds one at a time.
# when fast pointer is at the end of the linkedlist, slow pointer will be at the middle of the linkedlist
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        return slow
